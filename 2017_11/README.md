## NYCDSSG April 19th, 2017 Meetup

> **Presentor**:		Aileen Nielsen

> **Content**:			Probabilistic Graphical Models in Python: What, Why, and How in 45 minutes or less

> **Venue Host**:			Squarespace

> Abstract: 

This talk will give a high level overview of probabilistic graphical models and a practical introduction to available options for implementing graphical models in Python. We'll discuss what kinds of problems you can tackle with such models, and where they are currently deployed in research and industry.  Time allowing, we'll also take a quick detour into R to compare what is available in R vs. Python. We will conclude with a deep dive into some package source code and a discussion of the weaknesses and "to-do's" for current Python probabilistic graphical models.

> Speaker:

Aileen has worked in corporate law, physics research labs, and, most recently, a variety of NYC tech startups. Her interests range from defensive software engineering to UX designs for reducing cognitive load to the interplay between law and technology.  Aileen is currently working at an early-stage NYC startup that has something to do with time series data and neural networks. She also serves as chair of the New York City Bar Associationâ€™s Science and Law committee, which focuses on how the latest developments in science and computing should be regulated and how such developments should inform existing legal practices. In the recent past, Aileen worked at mobile health platform One Drop and on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. She is a frequent speaker at machine learning conferences on both technical and sociological subjects.
